      This concept originated from Buffon's experimentation with a coin (Peterson, 2008), 
      evolving into a calculated experiment to determine the probability of a needle crossing two wooden strips on the floor.
      His findings led to the approximation of Pi and the formulation of a key probability expression 
      for needle crossings: (2l) / πd (MSTE at the University of Illinois, n.d.).
      Through his experiment it has demonstrated that the more needles thrown,
      gives us a value closer to approximating the value of Pi

      In 1777, the French mathematician Georges Buffon unveiled his needle experiment,
      a unique approach to approximating pi by dropping needles onto a grid of parallel lines (Chudnovsky, 2017).
      Buffon's motivation stemmed from a profound curiosity about the intersection of mathematics and the physical world.
      His primary objectives were twofold: (Peterson, 2008) to empirically 
      test mathematical principles in a real-world context and to offer a tangible demonstration of probability concepts. 
      This innovative experiment was inspired by his initial inquiry into the probability of a coin falling across lines. 
      As he delved into this inquiry, Buffon expanded his investigation 
      to calculate the probability of needles crossing the lines, 
      leading to an exploration at the intersection of mathematics and probability theory.
      Thus, enabling him to derive an approximate value of π.

        Buffon’s needle experiment introduces the <u> method for approximating the mathematical constant PI</u>.
        Firstly, just draw 3 horizontal lines on the paper using a needle, which means that the 
        length of one matchstick is the same as the distance of the width of the parallel lines.
        Then you throw the needles randomly to see when it’ll cross the line.
        After this process we now calculate the probability of the needle that will intersect the nearest line.

        In figure 1 (Mind Your Decisions, 2016),  'd' is the distance between the middle of the needle
        and the closest parallel line; it also represents how close it is to intersect with a line. 
        It can be any number between 0 and 0.5 units (MSTE at the University of Illinois, n.d.).
        This is because a matchstick is 1 unit long, so if 'd' is more than 0.5 units, it won't intersect 
        with any lines no matter how it drops.The angle is in radians between the needle and the parallel lines 
        on the surface, where the needle is dropped with bounds between 0 &lt; θ &lt; π/2 
        as this restriction will allow the needle to intersect just one line (Mind Your Decisions, 2016).

        The vertical distance of the triangle (d2) in Figure 2 can be found by using basic trigonometry. 
        Then we need to work out the condition for the needle to cross the line, depending on the angle
        it makes from the locus of points.
        
        Opposite =  hypotenuse * sin
        Vertical distance (d2) = 1/2 * sin(&theta;)
        Now when calculating the probability of the needle, it needs to satisfy these conditions: 
        0 &lt; θ &lt; π/2 and d &le; 1/2 * sin(&theta;). Then it can be found by finding the area 
        under the curve defined by the function d &le; 1/2 * sin(&theta;) divided by the area of the 
        rectangle as shown in figure 2 (MSTE at the University of Illinois, n.d.).
        Probability = area under the graph/area of rectangle = A/B

     Finally, Buffon's needle experiment exemplifies the power of curiosity in shaping mathematical discoveries. 
     His original curiosity about the behaviour of a coin dropping across lines, Buffon investigated the chances of needles crossing parallel lines and discovered a revolutionary formula: (2l) / πd. 
     This experiment-derived formula, which shows how randomness—as seen in needle crossings—contributes to the estimation of pi, has become the foundation of modern mathematical algorithms.
     Buffon's experiment also brings light on the mutually beneficial relationship between mathematical growth and curiosity, acting as a historical beacon outside the realm of mathematical abstractions. 
     The experiment has a legacy that goes beyond mathematics and affects a variety of fields that depend on accurate computation, such as computer science, engineering, and physics. 
     Essentially, Buffon's needle experiment, driven by his intellectual curiosity, has permanently changed the mathematical environment.
